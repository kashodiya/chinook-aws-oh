# Epic 001: Infrastructure and MVP Music Browsing

## Description
Establish the foundational infrastructure and implement basic music browsing functionality to create a minimum viable product (MVP) that allows users to view the music catalog.

## User Stories

### Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] **US-001:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to create the initial Terraform configuration for AWS resources in us-east-1, so that we have a foundation for deploying our application
- [ ] **US-002:** As a developer, I want to have a basic CI/CD pipeline, so that code changes can be automatically built, tested, and deployed

### Backend Foundation
- [ ] **US-003:** As a backend developer, I want to create the initial database schema, so that we can store and retrieve music catalog data
- [ ] **US-004:** As a backend developer, I want to set up the Java API project structure, so that we have a foundation for building backend services
- [ ] **US-005:** As a backend developer, I want to create REST endpoints for browsing music, so that the frontend can retrieve catalog data

### Frontend Foundation
- [ ] **US-006:** As a frontend developer, I want to initialize the React application structure, so that we have a foundation for building the user interface
- [ ] **US-007:** As a customer, I want to browse the music catalog, so that I can discover available music
- [ ] **US-008:** As a customer, I want to view details about an album, so that I can learn more about it and see its tracks

### DevOps & Testing
- [ ] **US-009:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure the application deployment, so that the application can be accessed through the ELB
- [ ] **US-010:** As a QA engineer, I want to perform end-to-end testing of the initial functionality, so that we can verify the system works as expected

## Acceptance Criteria
- Basic Terraform modules created for AWS infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline configured for Java backend and React frontend
- Database schema created with tables for artists, albums, tracks, genres
- Spring Boot project initialized with basic API structure
- REST endpoints created for retrieving artists, albums, and tracks
- React project created with appropriate folder structure
- Music catalog browse page implemented with filtering by genre
- Album detail page showing album information and tracks
- Application deployed to AWS with frontend assets in S3
- End-to-end testing completed with documented results

## Dependencies
- AWS account access
- Development environment setup
- Team training on selected technologies

## Estimation
4 story points (2 weeks)
